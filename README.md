## How to run

## Configuration
For a general overview of the configuration files of GOFI please see the [documentation](https://uoe-agents.github.io/IGP2/configuration_file.html) of IGP2 (on which GOFI is based). 

We extend the scenario configuration files to include static objects in the map (e.g., buildings).
